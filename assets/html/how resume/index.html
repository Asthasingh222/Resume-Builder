              A resume is a document commonly used in the hiring process. 
            It includes information about your background and qualifications
             and should communicate the most important, relevant information 
             about you to employers in a clear, easy-to-read format. 
             The goal is to quickly communicate why you are uniquely qualified 
             for the position based on your skills and experiences.<br>
            To create a resume that will get noticed by employers, 
            you can follow a few simple steps and best practices. 
            The main goal to keep in mind is to make your resume relevant 
            and readable.
            </div>
            
            <h1>How to create a professional resume</h1><br>
            The following steps and examples will help you design a professional resume.
            <div class="step1">
              <h2>1. Start by choosing the right resume format</h2><br>
              Let’s take a closer look at the best ways to write each of these resume sections. 
              For more inspiration when writing or updating your resume, 
              look at resume samples from your industry and job title.
              A “format” is the style and order in which you display information 
              on your resume. There are three commonly used resume 
              formats you can choose from depending on which is right for you: 
              chronological (or reverse-chronological), functional or combination.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A chronological resume format places the professional history section
                   first and is a good option if you have a rich professional work 
                   history with no gaps in employment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The functional resume format emphasises the skills section and is a good 
                  option if you are switching industries or have some gaps in 
                  your work history.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The combination resume format is a good option if you have some professional 
                  experience where both skills and work history are equally important.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="step2">
              <h2>2. Include your name and contact information</h2><br>
              Your resume should begin with your name and contact information 
              including your email address and phone number. 
              You have a choice about whether to include your mailing address. 
              Your name should be highly visible at the top of your resume with
              a bolded or larger font than the rest of the document but no more 
              than a 14 point size.You might also include a link to your online 
              portfolio if you are applying to creative positions, for example.
            </div>
            <div class="step3">
              <h2>3.Add a resume summary or objective</h2><br>
              After your contact information, you have the option to include 
              either a resume summary or objective statement. 
              An objective statement quickly explains your career goals and 
              is a good choice for those with limited professional experience 
              such as recent college or high school graduates. 
              A resume summary is a short statement that uses active language 
              to describe your relevant work experience and skills.
            </div>
            <div class="step4">
              <h2> 4.List your soft and hard skills</h2><br>
              Take a moment to consider which skills make you a great fit for the job. 
              Review the job description and highlight keywords that you have had 
              proven success with in the past. Consider hard (technical) and soft 
              (interpersonal) skills, as well as transferable skills you can use 
              when changing careers or industries.
              Create a skills section with the keywords that are relevant to the 
              employer. List any required skills like certifications or licenses first.
            </div>
            <div class="step5">
              <h2>5.List your professional history with keywords</h2><br>
              Write your professional history section in reverse-chronological order. 
              Start with your most recent job and provide a short description 
              including the company name, time period in which you were employed, 
              your job title and a few key achievements during your time at the 
              company. You might also include relevant learnings or growth 
              opportunities you experienced while employed there.<br>
              When listing your professional history, you should keep a 
              few best practices in mind.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Use numbers to measure your impact when possible. </b>
                  Including specific numerical achievements can help employers 
                  understand your direct potential value to their company. 
                  Example: “Developed new process for requesting supplies, 
                  reducing fulfilment time by 10%.”
                </li>
                <li>
                 <b>Use keywords from the job description.</b> 
                  Similar to your skills section, you should also include 
                  information from the job description in your job history bullets. 
                  For example, if the job description mentions the importance of 
                  meeting sales quotas, you could include information about how 
                  you’ve met or exceeded quotas in past roles. 
                  Example: “Achieved goal of reaching 250% annual sales quota, 
                  winning sales MVP two quarters in a row.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Be brief.</b>
                  Be brief. Employers have mere seconds to review your resume, 
                  so you should keep your descriptions as concise and relevant 
                  as possible. Try removing filler words like “and” and “the”. 
                  You should also only list key achievements instead of multiple
                   lines describing your role.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Use action verbs.</b>
                  Make a stronger impact by using action verbs 
                  to describe your professional achievements. 
                  Some examples include “developed”, “saved”, “drove” and “managed”.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Follow the same process for other work experiences. If you do not 
              have extensive professional history, you should also include 
              internships and volunteer opportunities following the same format.
            </div>
            <div class="step6">
              <h2> 6. Include an education section</h2><br>
              An education section will be especially valuable if you have 
              limited work experience (such as recent college or high school 
              graduates) or if you are transferring to a new industry. 
              You can include information such as:
              <ul>
                <li>Relevant coursework</li>
                <li>Percentage or rank</li>
                <li>Participation in clubs or organisations</li>
                <li>Leadership positions held</li>
                <li>Awards, achievements or certifications</li>
              </ul>
              When writing your education section, you should include the 
              names of the institutions, dates of attendance and your 
              degrees or areas of study. If you are applying to mid or 
              higher-level positions, you might remove all but the name 
              of your school and dates of attendance to make room for more 
              relevant professional experience on your resume.<br>
              If you have certifications or licenses that are relevant 
              to the job description, you can include them in this section 
              as well. To save space, you can leave off any credentials 
              that are not directly related to the requirements of this job.
            </div>
            <div class="step7">
              <h2> 7. Consider adding optional sections</h2><br>
              If you have significant white space on your resume, consider 
              adding an achievements or interests section. This can help 
              supplement a shorter resume, especially for those with limited 
              work and educational experience. Make sure that the achievements 
              and interests you list support your career goals and are relevant 
              to potential employers.
            </div>
            <div class="step8">
              <h2>8. Format your resume</h2><br>
              While the layout of your resume is important, you should also 
              take time to pay attention to formatting details like font style, 
              font size, margins and spacing. Formatting your resume can make 
              it look clean, professional and improve readability. 
              This is important when attempting to keep your employer’s 
              attention. Here are a few key tips that can help make your 
              resume look polished.
              <ul>
                <li>Make your font between 10 and 12 point size.</li>
                <li>Select a font that is clean and easy to read like Arial or Helvetica; avoid stylised fonts.</li>
                <li>Make your name and section headers bold or slightly bigger in font size (no more than 14 points).</li>
                <li>Use bullet points when listing several different pieces of information like under your education and professional history sections.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="step9">
              <h2>9. Proofread your resume</h2><br>
              Carefully review your resume for spelling, grammar and 
              punctuation errors. Reading your resume backwards can 
              help you identify errors by presenting the words in a 
              new order. You should also ask trusted friends, colleagues, 
              professors and family members if they can review your resume. 
              Third-party opinions can help reveal new information you might 
              have overlooked.<br>
              If your resume is more than one page, review for ways to 
              consolidate or shorten each section by removing filler 
              words or extraneous information. Two pages may be acceptable 
              if you are applying for high-level positions or industries 
              like healthcare or academia.
            </div>
            <div class="step10">
              <h2>10. Tailor your resume for each position</h2><br>
              It’s important to revise your resume to tailor it to each 
              position you apply for. For each job, adjust the keywords 
              in the skills section so that it’s a great fit for what the 
              employer needs. You should also change what you emphasise 
              in the professional history and educational experiences 
              sections depending on what’s listed in the job description.
