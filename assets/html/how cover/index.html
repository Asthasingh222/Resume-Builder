                <h1>What is a cover letter?</h1><br>
                A cover letter is a one-page document that accompanies 
                your resume or CV when you apply for a job. See our guides 
                on how to write a resume and how to make a CV while you craft 
                your job application. 
                <br>
                A well-written cover letter can help you stand out from other 
                applicants and demonstrate your enthusiasm and passion for the 
                position. 
                <br>
                It serves as an opportunity for you to showcase your communication 
                and writing skills, as well as your attention to detail and 
                professionalism.
                <br>
                We’ll teach you how to write a good cover letter so that you can 
                craft this job-winning document with ease. Your cover letter should 
                accomplish the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduce yourself to the hiring managers.</li>
                    <li>Provide details about your qualifications.</li>
                    <li>Tell employers why you want to work for them.</li>
                    <li>Illustrate why you’re the best match for the job.</li>
                    <li>Explain circumstances like job hopping or gaps in employment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>What to include in a cover letter</h1>
                All cover letters follow a basic business letter structure and should 
                include the sections detailed below. 
                Explore our guide on what to include in a cover letter for a detailed
                 overview of each section.<br>

                <div class="step1">
                  <h2>1.Do your research</h2><br>
                  Wondering how to write a great cover letter? Preparation is key. 
                  Researching the essential information before you start writing will 
                  save you time and ensure you put your best foot forward.
                  <br>
                  First, review the job description to compare it with your 
                  professional skills and qualifications. Make a checklist of areas 
                  where your skills match the requirements of the job. 
                  Make note of the following areas: <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Notable accomplishments from previous jobs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Any volunteer work where you gained skills listed in the job description.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Skills that match the required skills in the job listing. Include a mix of hard skills and soft skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Educational qualifications, including certificates and licenses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Relevant awards and honors.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  Next, research the company to get a sense of its culture and values. This will help you create a personalized 
                  cover letter that indicates your genuine interest in the company. Take notes on the following areas: 
                  <div class="box2">
                      <span class="line-md--circle-to-confirm-circle-transition"></span> Get an idea of the company’s culture, mission and values so that you can tell the hiring manager why you’re a great fit.<br>
                      <span class="line-md--circle-to-confirm-circle-transition"></span> Research the company’s news and press releases so you can congratulate key players on recent milestones or explain how you will contribute to future goals.<br>
                      <span class="line-md--circle-to-confirm-circle-transition"></span> Learn the hiring manager’s name so that you can address your cover letter to them.<br>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <div class="step2">
                  <h2>2.Choose a cover letter template</h2><br>

                </div>
                <div class="step3">
                  <h2>3.Add a professional header</h2><br>
                    Cover letter headers follow the standard business letter format. 
                    A cover letter header typically includes your name, address, 
                    phone number and email address. It should be placed at the top 
                    of the page and aligned to the left or center.<br><br>
                    <h2>Include your contact information</h2>
                    Place your name, city, state, ZIP code, phone number and email address in your cover letter 
                    heading. Your email address should be professional like “Jdoe@email.com,” 
                    and not personal like “soccermom45@email.com.” Include links to your LinkedIn profile or 
                    professional online portfolio if you have one.
                    <div class="image2">

                    </div><br>
                    <h2>Include the recipient’s contact information</h2>
                    First, write the current date followed by a space. Then include the hiring manager’s name and title, company address and the hiring manager’s email address. It should look like this:
                    <div class="image2">
                      <img  class="tilt" src="/assets/images/recipients-address.png" alt="">
                    </div>

                </div>
                <div class="step4">
                  <h2> 4.Greet the hiring manager</h2><br>
                  Greet the hiring manager by name whenever possible to establish a personal connection. If you are unsure of their gender, you can use their first and last name. 
                  <br>
                  For example: “Dear [hiring manager’s full name],” 
                  <br>
                  If you are certain of the hiring manager’s gender, you can address them using “Mr.” or “Ms.” in your cover letter. Avoid using “Mrs.” or “Miss” as these titles imply that you are assuming the hiring manager’s marital status. 
                  <br>
                  Don’t use informal language like “Hello,” or “Hi,” or outdated salutations like“Dear Sir or Madam” or “To Whom it May Concern” to greet the person reading your letter. 
                  <br>
                  If your research doesn’t turn up a name, then use “Dear Hiring Manager” or “Dear Hiring Team.” Take a look at some acceptable and unacceptable salutations below.
                  <div class="box2">
                    <span class="line-md--circle-to-confirm-circle-transition"></span> Dear Lucy Garcia,<br>

                <div class="step5">
                  <h2>5.Write a compelling introduction</h2><br>
                  The opening sentences of a cover letter act as your elevator pitch. You should clearly and concisely tell hiring managers why you are the best fit for the job. 
                  <br>
                  But how do you start a cover letter in a way that intrigues hiring managers and makes them want to read more?
                  <br>
                  The following examples can help you write a cover letter introduction that grabs the attention of hiring managers.
                  <br>
                  <h2>Assert your interest in the role or company</h2>
                  Want to know how to write a cover letter that stands out? It all starts with a compelling introduction that confidently asserts your interest in the position.<br>

                  <h2>Emphasize your skills and experience</h2>
                  Start your cover letter off strong with a brief explanation of your top skills and experiences that make you a great fit for the role.
                  <div class="image2">
                    <img  class="tilt" src="/assets/images/step52.png" alt="">

                  <h2>Show you’ve done some research</h2>
                  Mention an interesting fact or statistic from an article, news story or the company’s website.
                  <div class="image2">
                    <img  class="tilt" src="/assets/images/step53.png" alt="">

                  <h2>Highlight measurable accomplishments</h2>
                  Showcase your qualifications by mentioning an impressive award, honor or measurable accomplishment from a past role.
                  <div class="image2">
                    <img  class="tilt" src="/assets/images/step54.png" alt="">
                  </div>
                  <h2>Tell your professional story</h2>
                  Tell a story about why you are applying. Discuss how your passion and motivation have driven your career choices and how they align with the position and company.
                  <div class="image2">
                    <img  class="tilt" src="/assets/images/step55.png" alt="">

                </div>
                <div class="step6">
                  <h2> 6. Include an education section</h2><br>
                  An education section will be especially valuable if you have 
                  limited work experience (such as recent college or high school 
                  graduates) or if you are transferring to a new industry. 
                  You can include information such as:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Relevant coursework</li>
                    <li>Percentage or rank</li>
                    <li>Participation in clubs or organisations</li>
                    <li>Leadership positions held</li>
                    <li>Awards, achievements or certifications</li>
                  </ul>
                  When writing your education section, you should include the 
                  names of the institutions, dates of attendance and your 
                  degrees or areas of study. If you are applying to mid or 
                  higher-level positions, you might remove all but the name 
                  of your school and dates of attendance to make room for more 
                  relevant professional experience on your resume.<br>
                  If you have certifications or licenses that are relevant 
                  to the job description, you can include them in this section 
                  as well. To save space, you can leave off any credentials 
                  that are not directly related to the requirements of this job.
                </div>
                <div class="step7">
                  <h2> 7. Consider adding optional sections</h2><br>
                  If you have significant white space on your resume, consider 
                  adding an achievements or interests section. This can help 
                  supplement a shorter resume, especially for those with limited 
                  work and educational experience. Make sure that the achievements 
                  and interests you list support your career goals and are relevant 
                  to potential employers.

                <div class="step8">
                  <h2>8. Format your resume</h2><br>
                  While the layout of your resume is important, you should also 
                  take time to pay attention to formatting details like font style, 
                  font size, margins and spacing. Formatting your resume can make 
                  it look clean, professional and improve readability. 
                  This is important when attempting to keep your employer’s 
                  attention. Here are a few key tips that can help make your 
                  resume look polished.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Make your font between 10 and 12 point size.</li>
                    <li>Select a font that is clean and easy to read like Arial or Helvetica; avoid stylised fonts.</li>
                    <li>Make your name and section headers bold or slightly bigger in font size (no more than 14 points).</li>
                    <li>Use bullet points when listing several different pieces of information like under your education and professional history sections.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="step9">
                  <h2>9. Proofread your resume</h2><br>
                  Carefully review your resume for spelling, grammar and 
                  punctuation errors. Reading your resume backwards can 
                  help you identify errors by presenting the words in a 
                  new order. You should also ask trusted friends, colleagues, 
                  professors and family members if they can review your resume. 
                  Third-party opinions can help reveal new information you might 
                  have overlooked.<br>
                  If your resume is more than one page, review for ways to 
                  consolidate or shorten each section by removing filler 
                  words or extraneous information. Two pages may be acceptable 
                  if you are applying for high-level positions or industries 
                  like healthcare or academia.
